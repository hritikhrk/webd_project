            <p>
                Math is the most theoritical subject. It is the toughest also as it is comprised of limited concepts but a variety of question can be made over those concepts.So without enough practice you won't be able to score good marks in it. 
            </p>
            <p>Math comprises of 5 parts :<br>Calculus, Algebra, Coordinate Geometry, Vector and 3D Geometry, Trigonometry.</p>
            <h4>CALCULUS</h4>
            <p>This topic is the most important topic in maths and you can expect 40% weightage given to this topic itself. Hence it is very important to focus a lot on this topic. Also some of the questions asked in JEE Advanced on this topic in the recent years are quite difficult and having ingenius solutions hence you should solve even the most difficult problems of this topic within the JEE syllabus.</p>
            <p>The correct strategy of excelling in this topic is to keep in mind the various techniques/tricks used while solving questions and when you learn a new trick think that how it can be applied to other questions of similar type. Also you should solve a lot of problems in this topic to make it your strength and once you cannot solve a problem do look-up for its solution so that you can get to learn an important concept which was maybe missed while learning the concepts.</p>

                            This book is for those who feel confident in the techniques used for solving questions and now wish to solve questions of high difficulty level. The problems of this book are at the maximum level of difficulty JEE can ask. This book is most useful if you have its solutions also so that you can look for the solutions to the questions you couldn't solve.

                <p>Vector and 3D is an essential part of JEE and there are usually about 3-4 questions from this topic every year in JEE Advanced .Most of the questions in vector are repeated ,thus solve archive fully and specially the subjective questions .For 3D most of the questions are cake walk if you have a good understanding of vector products and also their geometrical significance. It is strongly recommended to solve the questions of 3D by the vector method since it often proves to be the shorter method and in competitive exams, saving time is an essential factor.</p>

            <h4>TRIGONOMETRY</h4>
            <div class="inf">
                <p>Trigonometry is a quite vast topic in itself. It is one of those topics in which difficult questions can be made easily. There are a lot of trigonometry problems that have solutions through complex numbers, polynomials etc. and hence can be very difficult to deal with. But for JEE Advanced purpose only, there is quite less chance of such questions appearing in the exam since JEE usually asks simple questions from Trigonometry most of which are formula based.</p>

                        The best book for Trigonometry is of Amit M Agarwal. It first illustrates the concept and then poses problems on that concept. This book is designed for beginners who want to excel in the topic. It has a lot of solved examples to guide you through the various techniques of manipulation of terms used frequently in trigonometry. If you feel weak in this topic then you should go for it, I am sure you would benefit a lot from it.

                        Archive/Past Year papers are a must for every JEE aspirant. It gives you an idea about the type of questions asked in the exam and also the difficulty level of the problems. It also gives you an idea about whether your preparation is sufficient or not. I would recommend you to solve this book chapter-wise when you feel that your preparation of that chapter is sufficient to crack JEE problems or not. This book is for both JEE Mains and JEE Advanced and it is with solutions too.
