            <p>Chemistry has 3 parts : </p>
            Physical Chemistry<br>Inorganic Chemistry<br>Organic Chemistry<br>
            <h4>PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY</h4>
            <P>This is the most 'logical' part of chemistry and can be pretty much difficult if tackled with the wrong approach. If you are good in physics and have the ability to reason stuff I don't think you should face much difficulty in this topic. Throughout the years, the focus has shifted from lengthy(subjective) problems to short and conceptual objective problems. Hence, all the problems of physical chemistry asked in JEE Advanced have little or no calculation and have quite short solutions. So one should not focus much on solving lengthy problems(especially of Ionic Equilibrium & Thermodynamics) rather one should develop core understanding and conceptual clarity by reading theory books. One precaution to be taken while studying it is that you should not mug-up the concepts because there are hundreds of them in physical chemistry, rather you should build the links.</P>
            <P>Since the problems are divided into two categories-conceptual and numerical, we shall also divide the books into the same two categories.You must have at least one book from each category</P>
            <h5>CONCEPTUAL</h5>
            <div class="inf">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        So, the best book and a must buy for all on Physical Chemistry is Peter Atkins.
                        <br>
                        <b>(Highly recommended in Conceptual)</b>

                        </div>
                        <p>This is the most conceptual book for Physical Chemistry and explains every concept in detail. Since this is a foreign-author book not written for JEE, there are some topics not in JEE Advanced syllabus and hence need not be read. So your focus should be on :-</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I personally recommend Narendra Avasthi for numerical problems.<br>(Highly Recommended for Numerical)<br>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
                            <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Problems-Physical-Chemistry-Advanced-2019-2020/dp/9384934879/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1589890120&refinements=p_27%3ANARENDRA+AVASTHI&s=books&sr=1-1"><img src="naren.png" class="amz" alt="N Avasthi book"></a>
                        </div>
                        <p>This book offers the best advantage that it has problems divided in two difficulty levels which provides you with sufficient practice of easy problems covering a wide variety of concepts and also gives you a flavour of difficult problems along with hints and solutions of difficult problems. This book is also based on the recent pattern of JEE and also gives you notes of the important formulae/concepts at a glance.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h5>BOTH(CONCEPTUAL AND NUMERICAL)</h5>
            <div class="inf">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you want a single book which pays due respect to both the conceptual and the numerical part then P Bahadur is the best book to buy.<br>(Highly Recommended)<br>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
                            <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Numerical-Chemistry-Engineering-Examination-2018-2019/dp/9382314431/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1589890171&refinements=p_lbr_books_authors_browse-bin%3AP.+Bahadur&s=books&sr=1-1"><img src="bahadur.png" class="amz" alt="P Bahadur Book"></a>
                        </div>
                        <p>JEE Advanced asks questions from several topics like Solid State, Surface Chemistry, Nuclear Chemistry, Chemical Bonding, Liquid Solutions which are NOT well-covered in the books recommended in Conceptual category so far. The greatest advantage of this book is that it also deals with these chapters in a decent manner hence becomes a MUST-BUY book for JEE aspirants.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY</h4>
            <p>Inorganic is one of the most feared topic among students and usually becomes the rank deciding factor in the JEE exam .There are several cases from past year where the student neglected inorganic chemistry and it therefore lead to a poor rank .One must not leave Inorganic Chemistry for the last 2 months or so .One must study inorganic chemistry through out the 2 years regularly and make proper notes .Proper and Timely Revision is very important for Inorganic Chemistry .Inorganic Chemistry usually comprises 30-35% of the paper .I would suggest you to make a separate register for the reactions or properties of compounds that you forget or questions of inorganic that you are not able to solve and refer to that copy every now and then.Solving previous year questions are a must for Inorganic Chemistry</p>
            <p>Reading everyline of <b>NCERT</b> is a must for securing a good rank in JEE especially in Inorganic Chemistry. One must also solve the back questions of NCERT. Solve <b>Exemplar</b> along with this for more clarity of concepts on Inorganic .</p>
            <h5>THEORY BOOKS</h5>
            <div class="inf">
                <ul>
                    <li>

            </div>
            <h4>ORGANIC CHEMISTRY</h4>
            <p>This is the most important and also the most scoring topic of chemistry provided you understand the concepts well and develop your basics right . About 40% of the JEE paper is usually from Organic Chemistry .The most important chapter of Organic is Aldehydes and Ketones and must be studied rigorously .Seeing the latest trend ,JEE has been asking questions directly from foreign Author Books like "Morrison Boyd","Peter Sykes" etc .One must follow only Foreign author books for organic chemistry .Indian author books mostly are not much relevant and might contain lots of error .</p>
            <p>Your approach while studying Organic should not be to memorize but understand the mechanism for the reaction and the conditions used for the reaction .While studying ask yourself questions like why was this reagent used and why was this reactant taken for synthesis ?What would happen if other reactant was used instead of this? This approach would help you a lot for better understanding of the topic .</p>
            <div class="inf">
                <h5>THEORY BOOKS</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One of the best books for Organic chemistry is Morison Boyd .This books is best for studying reactions and for Biomolecules .<br>
                        <b>(Highly Recommended)</b><br>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">

                    <li>
                        Solomons and Fryle ,One of the most used book by students due to the simplicity and clarity of the concepts explained in the book .There are many versions of the book but any of the above can be used to study .The Stereochemistry part of the book is very well explained and written well.
                        <br><b>(Highly Recommended)</b><br>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>PROBLEM BOOKS</h5>
                For problems you can use either of these books .They are typicaly of the same level with slight variation in difficulty .I have arranged the books in increasing difficulty . One must practice sufficient problems specially of Stereoisomerism. Practising problems is a very essential part of becoming good inn Organic Chemistry since there are a lot of reactions and practising problems ensures that we know all the reactions.<br>

                        Archive/Past Year papers are a must for every JEE aspirant. It gives you an idea about the type of questions asked in the exam and also the difficulty level of the problems. It also gives you an idea about whether your preparation is sufficient or not. I would recommend you to solve this book chapter-wise when you feel that your preparation of that chapter is sufficient to crack JEE problems or not. This book is for both JEE Mains and JEE Advanced and it is with solutions too.
