            <h3>Strategy and Tips</h3>
            <h4>How to keep oneself motivated ?</h4>
            <p>Ah! I remember the days of my preparation for JEE. Difficult days they are, aren't they? Parents have expectation from us, Teachers have expectation from us, We have expectation from ourselves. Some exam might not go well and all the hopes seem to get shattered. A big question mark seems to be put to our capability of achieving. De-motivation might kick-in in such a scenario.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>But you need to remind yourself what a fighter you are. There have been exams in the past where you have not performed upto expectation and there would be such in the future too. But that shouldn't make the smile on your face fade away. "In a fight he who has the greatest strength doesn't win, rather the one who fights the best wins". You will get through this. Don't waste your time in getting demotivated and prepare harder for the next fight. Analyse your shortcomings in the previous paper and try to not repeat them this time.</p></li>
                <li><p>Take out some time to listen to songs which you love. It would give you enough motivation for the whole day and increase your dopamine levels.</p></li>
                <li><p>Take out some time to jog or do any other physical activity in fresh air. It would rejuvenate your mind and help you follow the difficult routine you ought to follow.</p></li>
                <li><p>It is not a bad idea to go out to meet friends for a couple of hours once a week. It would keep you excited and going through the phase.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you haven't yet, try to develop interest in the subjects. I am going to tell you a great psychology hack, it is upto you to make use of it. The more you think and convince yourself that the subject is interesting, the more you will start feeling that the subject is actually interesting. It might sound silly but it is scientifically proven. Once you have developed interest in the subject you are already half-way through !</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't keep upto yourself during these days. Talk to your friends who are preparing for the same exam regarding their preparation and ask them how they feel. This would make you realise that you are not the only one who feels this way! Talk to your friends and parents if you feel low or under-confident. Don't just start under-estimating your capabilities. You have to and will emerge as a winner. This is life. There are no losers in this game.</p></li>
                <li><p>Listen to motivational speakers. My favorite is Sandeep Maheshwari. In one of his videos, he compares life to a cricket match where there are no fielders and no stumps. Life is the bowler and you are the batsman. There are plenty of opportunities(balls) life will throw at you, doesn't matter if you miss a few. There is no way you can get out unless you yourself leave the pitch. So, keep fighting.</p></li>
                <li><p>Do meditation. Meditating for just 10 minutes a day can give you so much energy that you cannot imagine now. It will also help to increase your concentration levels hence reduce silly mistakes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Lastly, <b>BE HAPPY.</b>  Whatever happens to you don't lose your happiness. That is something no one can snatch away from you unless you give it away yourself. No one can defeat you unless you yourself accept your defeat. Always remember that whatever you are doing is for your happiness, not at the cost of it. You are a human, not a machine.</p></li>
